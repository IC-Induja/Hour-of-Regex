# Hour-of-Regex
A tutorial app that teaches the basics of Regex!
Inspired by my own struggles learning the foreign/arcane looking regex syntax when I 
was just getting started with regex.

Note: 
This app is still in it's minimum viable product phase. I hope to follow up soon with 
lessons on repetitions, as well as grouping and capturing. I also plan on adding a 
few fixes such as:
- having the keyboard hide automatically at the start of each lesson
- an expression tester mode where users can enter both a regex expression and some text,
  with all the matches automatically highlighted
